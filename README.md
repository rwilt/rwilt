## Hey, I'm Rosie! ðŸ¤ 

I'm a Black, female (she/her) software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY. I care about inclusivity, creativity, and meaningful action above transparency. My projects are centered around helping others and I'm looking for a role in tech that is aligned with those values. Outside of coding, I like Buffy the Vampire Slayer (if you couldn't tell), waving at cute dogs on the street, skincare, and serving my feline overlord, Bagel.
